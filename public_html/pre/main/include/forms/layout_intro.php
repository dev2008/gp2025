<h1>Graphic Layout</h1>

<p>From your <b>configuration file</b> (<i>/include/config_custom.php</i>) you can change:

<ul>
<li>The logo
<li>The colour theme
<li>The menu type
<li>The results grid type
</ul>

From your <b>custom CSS file</b> (<i>/css/styles_screen_custom.css</i>) you can add your CSS code, overriding the default one. Almost all the elements in the DaDaBIK interface has a CSS class or ID so you can customize the interface in great detail.<br><br>

From your <b>layout hooks file</b> (<i>/include/custom_functions/layout_hooks.php</i>) you can add your HTML, Javascript and PHP code to 15 different parts of your application layout, to customize them.<br><br>

From the <a href="datagrid_configurator.php?tablename=<?php echo $table_name; ?>">Datagrid templates page</a> you can create HTML templates to be used for overriding the standard results grid layout.<br><br>

Finally, you can <b>edit some DaDaBIK core files</b> used for generating the main elements of the layout (header.php, footer.php, results_grid.php, form.php, details.php); this approach, however, is not recommended (your changes will be lost when you upgrade DaDaBIK).<br><br>
