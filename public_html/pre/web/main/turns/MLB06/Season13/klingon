<Z>ROYAL SNAIL <C> The snail has been performing especially badly the last couple of weeks - everything is slow and some stuff<L.31.1>
is very slow (one player last week posted correctly addressed orders 1st class Monday, and they only arrived the Monday after).<L.31.1>
It really is better to input your orders online if you can. It's quicker, cheaper and more reliable.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>WEBSITES <C> The sidetracks.co.uk website has waiting lists, progress reports, rules updates, downloads and information about<L.31.1>
using the email system. Our main "static" info & stuff is at pbmsports.co.uk, while the softsim.co.uk website has credit cards<L.31.1>
and online turnsheets. Anyone can see the first two, but for softsim you need to ask for a user name before you can get into it.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
************************************************************************************************************************<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>CHANGES <C> Some changes to be introduced shortly, that are fairly simple and work nicely in Spaceplan but didn't get<L.31.1>
included in the Star Chase revival:<L.31.1>
1. Any attack through deep space is treated as being ambushed (the defender gets first shot).<L.31.1>
2. In a battle where the defender has fighters and no cruisers the defender fires first (ie. it's treated as a ambush battle).<L.31.1>
3. The effect of weapons tech is limited to the number of ships used (so 1 CRS + 10 WT = 2).<L.31.1>
4. The effect of marines tech is limited to the number of ships used.<L.31.1>
5. The effect of defence tech is limited to the number of population present.<L.31.1>
These should reduce the indiscrimate use of deep space movement and encourage attackers to get on with it and fight proper<L.31.1>
battles instead of fiddling about with attrition attacks.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>SHORT OF BPS? <C> It's quite common to have your "BPs Available" fall (even as low as zero) in the early stages of the game<L.31.1>
even though your income looks reasonable. Especially if you discover lots of ships as you explore. The solutions are<L.31.1>
(1) place your colony ships in systems that don't contain other ships and keep your cruisers dispersed one to a system,<L.31.1>
(2) reduce your supply costs by increasing your population,<L.31.1>
(3) reduce your supply costs by increasing your Supply Tech, and<L.31.1>
(4) stop building new ships until you can afford the supply cost.<L.31.1>
In the meantime you can get by with TAX actions, and don't miss the opportunity to gain treasury BPs by trading tech levels<L.31.1>
Trading also means you get to buy two tech levels in the turn instead of only one.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>HOME & BASE <C> If you don't want to use unspent BPs to build fighters in your "home" system or cruisers in your "base"<L.31.1>
system then you can stop this by making an empty HOME or BASE action (ie. with nothing or zero in the "where" column). If you<L.31.1>
want to build fewer, rather than none, then shift your base or home to somewhere with less industry.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>FIGHTERS <C> LAYUPF is the same as LAYUP except it puts fighters into reserve instead of cruisers. RESERVEF is the same as<L.31.1>
RESERVE only brings fighters out of reserve instead of cruisers. You can't do a RESERVEF the same turn as a LAYUPF (same as<L.31.1>
LAYUP and RESERVE) but you can layup one sort of ship while reserving the other.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>RECOVERY TECH <C> I have changed the two-letter code for Recovery Tech to be RC (it was previously RT). This is more<L.31.1>
consistent with Reserve Tech being RS and with Spaceplan (where RT is Robot Tech).<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>DEEPCOL <C> The DEEPCOL action moves colony ships (with attendant fighters, if present) through deep space. The cost is twice<L.31.1>
the the number of colony ships (multiples are allowed) times the square of the jump distance (ie. same as DEEP and MOVECOL<L.31.1>
multiplied together). They can still only move to stars, and only to ones you already own.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>PROBES <C> If you want to deactivate a probe, just activate another one that's a long way off (if you try to activate one in<L.31.1>
a location the active probe can reach, then the active one moves instead). Sometimes you need to waste a box activating a<L.31.1>
distant probe before going back to activate the one you want (if it's too close to the one that was previously active). The<L.31.1>
point of the current system is that it gets the most action for the given number of boxes: most of the time you can order one<L.31.1>
action per box - otherwise each action normally needs two or three or four boxes all to itself.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>TECH LEVELS <C> In Star Chase the capabilities of different empires can be very different, because the tech levels they own<L.31.1>
are different. Don't assume that other people have similar tech levels to you. Other people can do stuff that you can't.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>GROWTH LEVEL <C> This tech level (code is GL) adds population at the end of every every turn, one per system, in a number of<L.31.1>
systems equal to the growth level (ie. if GL is two, you get one pop in each of two systems). There's no cost in BPs and the<L.31.1>
systems are selected at random.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>VP PENALTIES <C> I've changed the VP penalty for losing systems to be equal to one plus the number of industry, population,<L.31.1>
and colony ships lost (that's rule 8.2 second paragraph). There is also a VP penalty for losing population and industry in<L.31.1>
planetary bomardments (equal to the number of population and industry lost). This is to make the end game more relevant, as in<L.31.1>
our other games, so that it's possible to make a decent fight of it and bring someone's VP total down.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>MAXBUILD <C> This is a "smart action" that builds the most industry you can afford as quickly and efficiently as it can (as<L.31.1>
distinct from the INCREASE action which builds the most cost effective/profitable). Don't do it too soon in the turn...<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>ASSAULTS <C> There's an error in rule 4.3 (assault actions). There are no extra losses for the different in weapons tech<L.31.1>
levels, which count as part of the attack and defence strenths as normal. The last line of the first paragraph should not be<L.31.1>
there and will be deleted in future rulebooks.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>RESERVES <C> There's an error in the version 2.0 and 2.1 rulebooks, will be fixed in future issues. The RESERVE action is<L.31.1>
sticky. It would be a good idea to make a note of the correction in your rulebook (in rule 4.10).<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>INCOME FOUND <C> I've made a small change so that where you discover BPs during exploration they get added to your BPs for<L.31.1>
the next turn instead of the current one. Which means you get to decide how to spend them on something useful.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>STASH ACTION <C> The website can't handle the special rule for STASH on action 16 (where you can STASH "ALL" even though you<L.31.1>
can't on earlier actions). The rule isn't needed any more, since unspent BPs already get stashed automatically at the end of the<L.31.1>
turn (without wasting an action) so this rule is being deleted. It does mean you may want to switch off your HOME and BASE<L.31.1>
options if you want the BPs stashed rather than spent on ships (other people do want their spare BPs spent on ships).<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>COLONY SHIPS <C> There's an error in the version 2.0 rulebook. The MOVECOL action can move more than one colony ship, so you<L.31.1>
should enter the number of ships to move in the NUMBER box. The cost is 2 BPs for each ship. The "ALL" and "ALL BUT" formats<L.31.1>
work, and if the box is blank it'll be taken as ALL.<L.31.1>
