The version of the library TCPDF distributed with DaDaBIK is slightly different from the original one (https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF), in particular:

- the file tcpdf.php has been slightly modified to make the images creation compatible with DaDaBIK. You can find the code added by looking at the comments "start DaDaBIK MOD" in the file itself.

- the "examples" folder has not been included

- the "tools" folder has not been included

- only the core fonts have been included, you can download additional fonts from https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF (fonts folder) and add them to this fonts folder. Please read the related licenses first.
