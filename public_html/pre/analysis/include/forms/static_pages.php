<p><font size="+1">Custom pages</font></p>
<p>You can add custom pages to your DaDaBIK application just by adding a record to the table <b>custom pages</b> from the <a href="<?php echo $dadabik_main_file; ?>">front-end</a>. (Please note that the custom pages table appears just if the logged user is an administrator but the resulting custom page is viewable by everybody).
