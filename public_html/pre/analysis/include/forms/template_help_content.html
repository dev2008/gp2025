The following is a template example for a table representing books.<br/><br/>

<div style="color:black;background:white;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">

dadabik_field title_book dadabik_field by &lt;span class=&quot;blue_text&quot;&gt;dadabik_field author_book dadabik_field&lt;br/&gt;<br/><br/>

dadabik_field publisher_book dadabik_field | dadabik_field year_book dadabik_field&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;<br/><br/>

dadabik_field url_book dadabik_field &lt;br/&gt;<br/><br/>

&lt;a href=&quot;dadabik_link details_link dadabik_link&quot; class=&quot;link_no_underline&quot;&gt;More&lt;/a&gt; dadabik_hide dadabik_groups 2|3 dadabik_groups(&lt;a href=&quot;dadabik_link edit_link dadabik_link&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a onclick=&quot;if (!confirm('Confirm delete?')){ return false;}&quot; href=&quot;dadabik_link delete_link dadabik_link&quot;&gt;del&lt;/a&gt;) dadabik_hide &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/><br/>
</div>

<br/>
As you can see, you need to put the name of each field you want to show between two <i>dadabik_field</i> tags. Note that you need a blank space before and after the field name, exactly as in the example.<br/><br/>

You can also add details, edit and delete links, to get the corresponding URLs you need to use the <i>dadabik_link details_link dadabik_link</i>, <i>dadabik_link edit_link dadabik_link</i> and <i>dadabik_link delete_link dadabik_link</i> tags.<br/><br/>
Please note that the details, edit and delete links in a custom template do not follow the rules set by permissions (as they do in the classic data grid), if you want tho hide one or more links to some users, please use the <i>dadabik_hide</i> tag (explained in the followings).<br/><br/>

You can hide some parts to one or more user groups using the tag <i>dadabik_hide</i> and <i>dadabik_groups</i>: in the example, everything between <i>dadabik_hide</i> and <i>dadabik_hide</i> will not be displayed if the current user belongs to the group 2 or 3. Again, pay attention to blank spaces.<br/><br/>

PLEASE NOTE that your database table can't contain the keywords <i>dadabik_link</i>, <i>dadabik_field</i>, <i>dadabik_hide</i> or <i>dadabik_groups</i> as data, otherwise the parsing will fail.<br/><br/>

Remember that you are responsible for adding a javascript confirmation pop-up, if you need it, for the delete link.<br/><br/>

You can add as much HTML as you want in order to customize the style of your results page.<br/><br/>
