The version of the library SPOUT distributed with DaDaBIK is slightly different from the original one (https://github.com/box/spout), some of the files have been modified to guarantee compatibility with PHP 8.1. You can find the code added by looking at the comments "start DaDaBIK MOD" in the files (when the code block is longer than a few lines, you will also see "end DaDaBIK MOD").
