<L.18.1>
<Z>Back from Holiday <C> As warned, I was away for a week, so catching up with turns. Back to normal next time......<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Gameplan Draft <C> I've added a hints and tips page on the draft to www.pbmsports.com (you can find it via the Gameplan page). <L.31.1>
I'd think most players will know this stuff, but it may help newer players, and there is a table of fixing costs & waiver values.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Gridstats <C> Has just restarted for the new NFL season. If you fancy a bit of fantasy action, let me know and I'll sort you<L.31.1>
out with a team, the FREESTART option applies, so you can try it for a couple of turns for nothing.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Online Turnsheets <C> Please make sure when you input turns online you get the week/turn number correct (it's on your turnsheet).<L.31.1>
If you get it wrong, there's a risk the turn gets missed. Please also avoid double submission of turns - if they're within minutes<L.31.1>
the system will only take the latest set, but if they're spread out both may be input and you'll get charged 0.1 credit.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Slack <C> There's an independent (i.e. I'm not on it) group on Slack of various players in various games (Gameplan, Raceplan,<L.31.1>
Baseball, etc) covering things run here (and probably offering hints and advice, which may or may not be accurate). For more<L.31.1>
information, go to gameplanpbm.slack.com, or for an invite contact Alan Milnes on alan@gameplan.org.uk<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Trial Startups <C> The offer of a free trial startup remains available throughout 2025. If you fancy picking up a new team, or<L.31.1>
trying a different game, check out the options on www.pbmsports.com and drop me a line<L.31.1>
