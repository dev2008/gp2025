<Z>This Turn <C> I doubt many even noticed, but in error last time I typed the deadline as Saturday 4th, rather than Thursday 2nd <L.31.1>
(combination of catching up, given I was running it on Saturday, and maybe habit). Nonetheless, the deadline is of course the<L.31.1>
Thursday (the same message file implied it) and it looks like everyone has submitted orders (bar a few folk who often miss orders)<L.31.1>
so I have processed "on time" so that you get results on the day you expect. Apologies for any confusion......<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Credits <C> Please can people make sure they keep credits topped up. There are a few folk who seem to have a habit creeping in of<L.31.1>
running out, and then creating extra work by asking me to send out their game report. If it's persistent, I'll be reinstating the<L.31.1>
extra credit charge for the extra hassle caused. It's a small minority, so please keep on top of them.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Gameplan Draft <C> I've added a hints and tips page on the draft to www.pbmsports.com (you can find it via the Gameplan page). <L.31.1>
I'd think most players will know this stuff, but it may help newer players, and there is a table of fixing costs & waiver values.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Online Turnsheets <C> Please make sure when you input turns online you get the week/turn number correct (it's on your turnsheet).<L.31.1>
If you get it wrong, there's a risk the turn gets missed. Please also avoid double submission of turns - if they're within minutes<L.31.1>
the system will only take the latest set, but if they're spread out both may be input and you'll get charged 0.1 credit.<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Slack <C> There's an independent (i.e. I'm not on it) group on Slack of various players in various games (Gameplan, Raceplan,<L.31.1>
Baseball, etc) covering things run here (and probably offering hints and advice, which may or may not be accurate). For more<L.31.1>
information, go to gameplanpbm.slack.com, or for an invite contact Alan Milnes on alan@gameplan.org.uk<L.31.1>
<L.12.1>
<Z>Trial Startups <C> The offer of a free trial startup remains available throughout 2025. If you fancy picking up a new team, or<L.31.1>
trying a different game, check out the options on www.pbmsports.com and drop me a line<L.31.1>
