Step 4/4: Files copy, Database update
I am unzipping the file upgrades_615563d11ba1f/dadabik_11.1-Elba_enterprise.zip ...Done!

I am craeting a backup of your config.php file as include/config_bkp_20210930.php ...Done!

I am copying files from upgrades_615563d11ba1f/dadabik_11.1-Elba_enterprise/program_files to the root folder ... Done!

I am copying the documentation file from upgrades_615563d11ba1f/dadabik_11.1-Elba_enterprise/program_files to the ./docs_dadabik_11.1-Elba_enterprise folder ... Done!

I am deleting the temporary upgrades folder ... Done!

I am deleting old, unnecessary files ... Done!

I am updating your dadabik_ tables ... Done!

I am registering your upgrade ... Done!

In your docs_dadabik_11.1-Elba_enterprise folder, you can find some important documents such as the documentation, the change log, the license and the FAQs.

As a security measure, you should now delete the files up.php and up2.php and (if they exist) the files upgrade.php, upgrade2.php, install.php, install2.php, since they could be used by malicious users.

It's also a good security practice to change the parameter $dadabik_session_name in config_custom.php (and in the Wordpress DaDaBIK Wrapper if you use it) using a name you haven't used in the past; this will make invalid all the current sessions: those sessions might in fact have potentially dangerous content (think about a security fix) or content not compatible with the new version.

DaDaBIK has been correctly upgraded. After having completed all the activities listed above you can start using it. You might need to clean the cache of your browser to correctly load the latest versions of some files (e.g. CSS files and pictures).
