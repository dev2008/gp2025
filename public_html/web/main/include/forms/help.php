<p>If you need help please check the <a href="https://dadabik.com/index.php?function=show_documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://dadabik.com/index.php?function=show_faqs" target="_blank">FAQs</a> first. Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/dadabik" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> is also full of tutorials and HOWTOs.</p>


<p>If you still need technical support and you purchased DaDaBIK Enterprise or Platinum, you can write an email to <strong>support [at] dadabik [dot] org</strong>. We can read English, Italian, Spanish, French. In all the other cases, you have to use the public <a href="https://dadabik.com/forum">forum</a> instead.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dadabik.com/forum">forum</a> is anyway a great source of knowledge for all users, with 20,000+ posts published by the DaDaBIK community during the years. Beside the Support forum there are a Feature requests forum, a General Discussion forum and a Support forum in Italian.
